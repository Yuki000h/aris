## Features

Student can view the following:

- Profile
- School year and semester
- Courses/subjects taken per semester
- Grades per subject
- Remaining balance
- Add email inquiries to your professors regarding the computed grades. No processing of email only
  the user interface.

## Scope

The scope of each of the projects is as follows:

- The flow of your application should portray:
- Target users
- Smooth flow of the process
- Should be able to show normal flow and alternate flow
- Should be able to show exemptions/error messages
- Should be able to show how the application looks on different devices (models)
- No need to save the transactions to a database because it is not covered in this course
- Focus on the design and on user experience

## Constraints

- No real-time processing required (database involved). If ever you know how to use cloud
  databases/API, it will not be part of the grading and requirements.
